# **Introduction** - **Markdown**

## Markdown was developed in 2004 by John Gruber, and refers to both a way of forming text files and a utility in the Perl programming language to convert Markdown files into HTML

### In this lesson we will focus on the first meaning and learn how to write files using Markdown syntax

### Plain text files have many advantages over other types of formats. On the one hand, they can be read on practically all devices

#### They've also stood the test of time better than other types of files - if you've ever tried to open a document saved in a legacy word processing format, you'll be familiar with the compatibility issues involved
