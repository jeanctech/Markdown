## What is Markdown?

Markdown – is a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz that seeks to achieve maximum readability and publishability in both its input and output forms, drawing inspiration from many existing conventions for marking up email messages using plain text.

## Introduction

It is distributed under the Bsd license and is distributed as a plugin, or at least it is available in different Cms content management systems. Markdown converts marked up text into Xhtml documents using html2text created by Aaron Swartz. Markdown was originally implemented in Perl by Gruber, but has since been translated into a multitude of programming languages, including Php, Python, Ruby, Java, and Common Lisp.

## Important information and frequently asked questions

Currently the course is in process. The basic, intermediate and backend blocks have been started, and that was the initial goal of the project. And then I don't rule out adding new lessons in the future, but I think that for now it can serve as a basis for anyone who wants to start learning this language.

* As soon as the course continues I will update the repository and notify the networks.
Thank you very much for all the support shown!
