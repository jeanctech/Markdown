## Introduction

It is distributed under the Bsd license and is distributed as a plugin - or at least available in different content management systems Cms. Markdown converts marked up text into XHTML documents using html2text created by Aaron Swartz. Markdown was originally implemented in Perl by Gruber, but has since been translated into a multitude of programming languages, including Php, Python, Ruby, Java, and Common Lisp

## Important information and frequently asked questions

Currently the course is in process. The basic, intermediate and backend blocks have been started, and that was the initial objective of the project. And after that I don't rule out adding new lessons in the future, but I think that for the moment it can serve as a basis for anyone who wants to start learning this language.

* As soon as the course continues, I will update the repository and notify the networks.
Thank you very much for all the support shown!
