# **Syntax** - **Markdown**

## **Markdown structure**

### 1. Headers

#### Headers in Markdown are created using one or more "#" symbols followed by a space and the header text. The more "#"s you use, the lower the level of the header. For example

```Markdown
# Level 1 Header
## Level 2 Header
### Level 3 Header
#### Level 4 Headings
##### Level 5 Headings
###### Level 6 Headings

### ***"Text Content"***

---

### Markdown files are saved with the .md extension and can be opened in a text editor such as TextEdit, Notepad, Sublime Text or Vim. Many websites or publishing platforms also offer web-based editors and/or extensions for entering text using Markdown syntax.
